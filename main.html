	<h1> Time Space and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
		Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input.
		It is a crucial factor when designing efficient algorithms, as it helps in determining how scalable the algorithm is when the input size grows.
	</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> deals with the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses relative to the input size.
		It is often expressed using Big O notation, like O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.
		Optimizing Space Complexity is important for making algorithms more memory efficient.</p>
